# Finbro Backend Assessment

## Current Development State

### Overall Progress: ~40-50% Complete

The backend has a solid foundation with core functionality partially implemented, but lacks production-ready security measures and complete feature coverage.

### Technology Stack

-   **Framework**: Gin (Go web framework)
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL with GORM ORM
-   **Authentication**: JWT tokens (golang-jwt/jwt/v4)
-   **Password Hashing**: bcrypt (golang.org/x/crypto)
-   **Environment**: godotenv for configuration

## Implemented Features

### Authentication System

-   JWT token-based authentication
-   OAuth user creation/login flow
-   Password hashing with bcrypt
-   User type determination (individual/business)

### User Management

-   User profile retrieval with account preloading
-   Profile updates (first name, last name)
-   OAuth user creation with email-based user type detection

### Account Management

-   Account retrieval by ID with user ownership verification
-   User-scoped account access

### Transaction Management

-   Transaction creation (partial implementation shown)
-   Transaction updates with user ownership verification
-   Basic transaction fields (description, category, date)

## API Endpoints

Based on the handler implementations, the following endpoints are available:

### User Endpoints

-   `GET /profile` - Get user profile with accounts
-   `PUT /profile` - Update user profile (first name, last name)

### Account Endpoints

-   `GET /accounts/:id` - Get specific account by ID

### Transaction Endpoints

-   `POST /transactions` - Create new transaction
-   `PUT /transactions/:id` - Update existing transaction

### Authentication Endpoints

-   OAuth integration endpoints (implementation details not shown)

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities

### ðŸ”´ High Priority Issues

1. **Missing Input Validation**

    - No validation middleware beyond basic JSON binding
    - Potential for malformed data injection
    - No sanitization of user inputs

2. **Insufficient Authentication Verification**

    - Handlers assume `user_id` exists in context without verification
    - No middleware to ensure JWT token validity
    - Missing authorization checks

3. **Password Security Concerns**

    - Code shows `user.Password = ""` suggesting passwords might be exposed
    - No password strength requirements visible

4. **No Rate Limiting**

    - Financial APIs vulnerable to brute force attacks
    - No protection against DoS attacks
    - Missing request throttling

5. **Missing Security Headers**

    - No CORS configuration visible
    - Missing security middleware (CSRF, XSS protection)
    - No request size limits

6. **Error Information Disclosure**
    - Generic error messages might expose internal structure
    - No error sanitization for client responses

## Performance & Efficiency Issues

### Database Concerns

-   **N+1 Query Risk**: `Preload("Accounts")` in user profile could be inefficient
-   **Missing Indexes**: No visible database optimization
-   **No Connection Pooling**: Configuration not shown
-   **No Pagination**: List operations could return unlimited results

### Code Structure Issues

-   **Repetitive Error Handling**: Same error patterns repeated across handlers
-   **Hardcoded Values**: Business domains hardcoded in `determineUserType()`
-   **No Caching**: Frequently accessed data not cached
-   **Missing Logging**: No structured logging system

## Missing Critical Features

### Security Features

-   [ ] Input validation middleware
-   [ ] Rate limiting
-   [ ] CORS configuration
-   [ ] Request logging
-   [ ] Security headers middleware
-   [ ] API key management

### Development Features

-   [ ] Database migrations
-   [ ] Comprehensive testing suite
-   [ ] API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
-   [ ] Health check endpoints
-   [ ] Metrics and monitoring

### Business Logic

-   [ ] Complete CRUD operations
-   [ ] Transaction categorization
-   [ ] Account balance calculations
-   [ ] Financial reporting endpoints
-   [ ] Data export functionality

## Immediate Action Items

### Security (Critical - Before Any Deployment)

1. Implement input validation middleware
2. Add authentication verification middleware
3. Configure rate limiting
4. Set up CORS policies
5. Add request logging and monitoring
6. Implement proper error handling

### Performance (High Priority)

1. Add database indexes
2. Implement pagination
3. Set up caching layer
4. Optimize database queries
5. Add connection pooling configuration

### Development (Medium Priority)

1. Create database migrations
2. Add comprehensive tests
3. Generate API documentation
4. Set up structured logging
5. Add health check endpoints

## Recommendations

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)

-   Focus on security vulnerabilities first
-   Implement proper middleware stack
-   Add input validation and sanitization
-   Set up basic monitoring

### Medium Term (1 month)

-   Complete missing CRUD operations
-   Add comprehensive testing
-   Implement proper error handling
-   Add API documentation

### Long Term (2-3 months)

-   Performance optimization
-   Advanced financial features
-   Reporting and analytics
-   Production deployment preparation

## Risk Assessment

**Current Risk Level: HIGH** - Not suitable for production deployment due to security vulnerabilities.

**Primary Concerns:**

-   Financial data exposure risk
-   Authentication bypass potential
-   DoS attack vulnerability
-   Data integrity issues

The foundation is solid with good technology choices, but security hardening is essential before any production use.
